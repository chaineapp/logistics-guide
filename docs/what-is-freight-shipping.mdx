# What is Freight?

Freight refers to goods or cargo that are transported by truck, train, plane, or ship. It can include a wide range of items, such as raw materials, finished goods, and manufactured products. Freight is typically shipped in large quantities, and it is often used by businesses to move products from their warehouses or factories to retail locations or to other businesses.

There are several different types of freight, including dry freight, which refers to goods that are not perishable or temperature-sensitive, and refrigerated freight, which refers to goods that require temperature-controlled transportation. Freight can also be classified based on its size and weight, with options ranging from small packages to full truckloads.

Freight shipments are over 150 pounds and most are loaded on to pallets (4,600 lbs / pallet).

# What is Freight Shipping?

Freight shipping refers to the transportation of goods or cargo from one place to another, typically by truck, train, plane, or ship. It is a common method of transporting large quantities of goods, and it is often used by businesses to move products from their warehouses or factories to retail locations or to other businesses.

There are several different types of freight shipping, each with its own set of requirements and characteristics.

1. Truckload shipping, also known as TL shipping, is a type of freight shipping that involves the transportation of a full truckload of goods that fills an entire semi-truck's trailer(s). This type of shipping is typically used for large shipments that fill an entire truck, and it is often the most cost-effective option for businesses shipping large quantities of goods.

   - Weight requirement: 15,000+ lbs.
   - Pallet count: 10 or more
   - Linear feet: Up to 53'

1. Partial truckload shipping is a type of freight shipping that involves the transportation of a partial truckload of goods. This type of shipping is typically used for shipments that are larger than those shipped via LTL shipping, but not large enough to fill an entire truck.

   - Weight requirement: 5,000-40,000 lbs.
   - Pallet count: 5-14
   - Linear feet: 10'-28'

1. Less-than-truckload shipping, or LTL shipping, is a type of freight shipping that involves the transportation of smaller shipments that do not fill an entire truck. This type of shipping is often used for smaller shipments that are too large to be shipped via parcel delivery, but not large enough to fill an entire truck.

   - Weight requirement: <4,000 lbs.
   - Pallet count: 1-6
   - Linear feet: Up to 12'

1. Shared truckload shipping is a type of freight shipping that involves the transportation of goods that are shared by multiple shippers on the same truck, and don't pass through hubs or terminals unlike LTL. This type of shipping is typically used to help reduce costs for businesses shipping smaller quantities of goods.
   - Weight requirement: < 36,000 lbs.
   - Pallet count: 4-22
   - Linear feet: 8-44'

Overall, freight shipping is an important part of the logistics process for businesses of all sizes. It allows companies to efficiently and cost-effectively transport large quantities of goods, and it is a vital component of the global supply chain.
