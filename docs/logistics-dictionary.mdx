### Backhaul

In the trucking industry, a backhaul refers to a return trip that a truck makes after completing a delivery. For example, if a truck delivers a load of goods from a manufacturer to a retailer, the return trip from the retailer back to the manufacturer is referred to as a backhaul.

Backhauls are important because they help trucking companies to maximize their utilization of their trucks and drivers. Rather than returning empty, a truck can pick up a new load on its backhaul trip, which helps to offset the cost of the trip and increase the profitability of the company.

Backhauls can be arranged through a variety of means, such as through brokers who match available capacity with shipper needs, or through direct contracts between shippers and carriers. Trucking companies may also use technology tools, such as load boards or transportation management systems, to find and book backhaul loads.
