# The Different types of carriers in trucking

There are several types of [carriers](./what-are-carriers-in-trucking.mdx) in the trucking industry, including:

1. For-hire carriers: These carriers provide transportation services to shippers on a fee basis and are typically regulated by the federal government. They may operate their own fleet of trucks or may use leased or rented equipment.

1. Private carriers: These carriers operate their own fleet of trucks and use them to transport their own goods, rather than providing transportation services to other [shippers](../shippers/what-are-shippers-in-logistics.mdx). Private carriers are typically not regulated by the federal government.

1. Less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers: These carriers specialize in transporting smaller shipments that do not require a full truckload. LTL carriers typically consolidate shipments from multiple shippers onto a single truck and charge by the weight or volume of the shipment.

1. Full truckload (FTL) carriers: These carriers specialize in transporting larger shipments that require a [full truckload](../../logistics-basic-structure-of-us-truckload-market.mdx). FTL carriers typically transport a single shipper's goods on a single truck and charge a flat rate for the entire load.

1. Specialized carriers: These carriers offer specialized transportation services, such as handling hazardous materials, oversized loads, or temperature-controlled shipments. Specialized carriers may have additional equipment or training to meet the requirements of these types of shipments.

Overall, the type of carrier a shipper chooses will depend on the type and size of the shipment, as well as the distance it needs to be transported and any specialized requirements that may be involved.
