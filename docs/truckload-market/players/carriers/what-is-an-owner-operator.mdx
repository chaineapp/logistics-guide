# What is an owner-operator in trucking?

An owner-operator in trucking is a [professional truck driver](./what-is-a-truck-driver.mdx) who owns and operates their own truck and [trailer](../../types-of-truckload-trailers.mdx), rather than working for a carrier or fleet as an employee. Owner-operators are responsible for all aspects of their business, including finding and securing shipments, maintaining their equipment, and managing their finances.

Owner-operators may work with [shippers](../shippers/what-are-shippers-in-logistics.mdx) directly (less common) or through intermediaries such as [freight brokers](../freight-brokers/what-are-freight-brokers.mdx) to find and secure shipments. They may also work with [carriers](./what-are-carriers-in-trucking.mdx) or fleets on a subcontract basis, providing their own equipment and drivers for specific shipments.

Owner-operators have the freedom and independence of running their own business, but they also bear a greater level of risk and responsibility. In addition to managing the operational and financial aspects of their business, they are also responsible for complying with all relevant regulations and standards.

Overall, owner-operators are an important part of the trucking industry, providing a vital service to shippers and helping to facilitate the [movement of goods from one location to another](../../../supply-chain/how-products-move-in-a-supply-chain.mdx).
