# What is a carrier sales representative at freight brokerages?

Carrier sales representatives are employees at freight brokerages who are responsible for representing the brokerage to carriers and negotiating rates and contracts with them. They may also be involved in identifying new carrier partners and building relationships with existing carriers.

Carrier sales representatives work closely with the operations and dispatch team to ensure that there are sufficient carriers available to handle the brokerage's shipments. They may also be involved in managing carrier performance and addressing any issues that may arise during the transportation process.

In summary, carrier sales representatives are responsible for managing relationships with carriers, negotiating rates and contracts, and identifying new carrier partners. They play a crucial role in ensuring that the brokerage has the capacity to handle the volume of shipments it receives from its clients.
