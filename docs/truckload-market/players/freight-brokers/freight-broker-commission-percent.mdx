[Freight agents](./what-are-freight-agents.mdx) have higher commission than employeed (W-2) freight brokers. These agents will work under a license freight brokerage, and focus on obtaining their own customers and growing their book of business. Back-office tasks such as billing, invoicing, claims, IT, rating, etc.. is handled by the freight brokerage.

- Freight agents are generally on a commission split that will vary around 40-70% of the profit.
- The licensed freight brokerage keeps 30-60% of the profit which is used for running the back-office tasks and their own profitability.
