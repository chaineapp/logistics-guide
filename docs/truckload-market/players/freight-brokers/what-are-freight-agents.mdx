# What is a Freight Agent?

A freight agent is a person or company that works with a third-party logistics provider (3PL) or a freight forwarding company to handle the logistics and transportation of goods for shippers. The freight agent acts as a sales representative for the 3PL or freight forwarding company, and is responsible for finding and securing business from shippers. The freight agent typically works on a commission basis and does not own or operate any transportation equipment.

## Freight broker vs freight agent

[Freight brokers](./what-are-freight-brokers), on the other hand, are responsible for arranging the transportation of goods on behalf of shippers. They do this by finding carriers to haul the goods and negotiating rates with them. Freight brokers are required to have a motor carrier authority from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), which allows them to legally broker transportation services. In addition, freight brokers must also hold a surety bond of $75,000 to protect shippers in the event that a carrier fails to deliver the goods as promised.

## Independent freight agents

Independent freight agents are similar to regular freight agents, but they work on a freelance or independent contractor basis. They may work with multiple 3PLs or freight forwarding companies and have more flexibility in terms of the types of shipments they handle and the carriers they work with. However, independent freight agents do not have the same level of support or resources as regular freight agents, and they may have to bear more of the financial risk associated with securing and fulfilling shipments.
