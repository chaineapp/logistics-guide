# U.S. Truckload Market

Learn about the U.S Truckload market

## What is Long-Haul trucking?

Long-haul trucking refers to the transportation of goods or [freight](../what-is-freight-shipping.mdx) over long distances, typically across state or national borders. Long-haul trucking is a critical part of the [global supply chain](../supply-chain/what-is-a-supply-chain.mdx), as it enables the movement of goods from manufacturers to customers and helps to keep economies running smoothly.

Long-haul trucking typically involves a [driver](./players/carriers/what-is-a-truck-driver.mdx) transporting goods in a tractor-trailer truck, typically employed by [truck carriers](./players/carriers/what-are-carriers-in-trucking.mdx). The driver is responsible for driving the truck to the destination where loading and unloading of the cargo happens. Drivers typically work long hours and may be on the road for several days at a time.

To operate a long-haul truck, a driver must obtain a commercial driver's license (CDL), which requires completing specialized training and passing a written and skills test. Drivers must also adhere to federal and state regulations governing hours of service, vehicle maintenance, and other safety measures.

Long-haul trucking companies typically use a variety of strategies to optimize their operations, such as using [advanced logistics software](../software/types-of-software.mdx) to plan routes and schedule deliveries, and implementing fuel-efficient driving practices. They may also use a variety of transportation modes, such as rail or air, to move goods over long distances.

Overall, long-haul trucking plays a vital role in the global supply chain by enabling the movement of goods over long distances and helping to ensure that products are delivered to customers in a timely and cost-effective manner.

America's trucking industry is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. In fact, nearly every good consumed in the U.S. is put on a truck at some point. As a result, the trucking industry hauled 72.5% of all freight transported in the United States in 2019, equating to 11.84 billion tons. The trucking industry was a $791.7 billion industry in that same year, representing 80.4% of the nation’s freight bill.
Three words that describe the U.S. Truckload market:

- Vast.
- Fragmented.
- Dynamic.

Low barriers to entry (and exit), a limited regulatory environment and hundreds of thousands of market participants spending nearly $800B annually in gross freight revenues create a volatile environment where truckload rates and carrier capacity are rarely in a state of equilibrium.

Between the [constant volatility](./logistics-3-cycles-us-tl-market.mdx) and a rapid influx of new technologies, the U.S. truckload market can be difficult to navigate.

Even though it may seem chaotic, the heart of the market beats to a consistent rhythm (as it has for decades): the continual ebb and flow of supply and demand.

This re-balancing act creates a predictable pattern. By measuring this pattern, we can clearly see a recurring cycle.

As long as the basic structure of the market remains the same (huge, fragmented carrier base), we can expect the cycle to continue repeating with some regularity.
