# What is full truckload (FTL)

The full truckload (FTL) market refers to the segment of the [trucking industry](./what-is-long-haul-trucking.mdx) that specializes in transporting larger shipments or [freight](../what-is-freight-shipping.mdx) that require a full truckload. Full truckload [carriers](./players/carriers/what-are-carriers-in-trucking.mdx) typically transport a single [shipper's](./players/shippers/what-are-shippers-in-logistics.mdx) goods on a single truck and charge a flat rate for the entire load.

FTL shipments are typically larger and more time-sensitive than [less-than-truckload (LTL)](./what-is-less-than-truckload) shipments, which are consolidated from multiple shippers onto a single truck. FTL shipments may also require [specialized equipment](./types-of-truckload-trailers) or handling, such as refrigerated trailers for temperature-controlled shipments.
