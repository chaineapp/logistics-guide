What are the different types of trailers in trucking and logistics?

A trailer is what attaches to the back of the truck. There are several types of trailers used in the trucking and logistics industry, including:

1. Dry van trailers: These are the most common type of trailer and are used to transport a wide variety of goods or [freight](../what-is-freight-shipping.mdx), including manufactured goods, raw materials, and consumer products. Dry van trailers are typically enclosed and do not have temperature control.

1. Refrigerated trailers: These trailers are equipped with temperature control systems and are used to transport perishable goods, such as food, pharmaceuticals, and flowers, that need to be kept at a specific temperature.

1. Flatbed trailers: These trailers have an open platform and are used to transport oversized or oddly-shaped loads that cannot be easily loaded into an enclosed trailer. Flatbed trailers may also be equipped with side kits or tarps to protect the load from the elements.

1. Tank trailers: These trailers are used to transport liquids or gases and are equipped with tanks to hold the cargo. Tank trailers may be pressurized or insulated, depending on the type of cargo being transported.

1. Lowboy trailers: These trailers have a low deck height and are used to transport heavy loads, such as construction equipment or machinery. Lowboy trailers may be equipped with ramps or other loading aids to facilitate the loading and unloading of the cargo.

1. Step deck trailers: These trailers have a lower deck height at the front and a higher deck at the rear, allowing them to transport loads that are taller than a standard trailer. Step deck trailers are often used to transport oversized or oddly-shaped loads.
