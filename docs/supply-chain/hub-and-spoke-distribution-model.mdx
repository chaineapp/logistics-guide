# What is a Hub and Spoke Distribution Model in Modern Supply Chains?

A hub and spoke distribution model is a common design used in modern supply chain management. It involves the centralization of certain activities, such as warehousing and transportation, at a central hub location, while smaller spoke locations are used for distribution to customers. Hence the name, it resembles the structure of a bicycle wheel where the center of the wheel is the hub (or distribution center) and each spoke is the direction of delivery.

The hub and spoke model is different from the point-to-point model, which involves a direct connection between two locations without a central hub. In a point-to-point model, each location may be responsible for its own warehousing and transportation activities, and since there is no centralized warehouse or distribution center, this can be less efficient and more costly than using a central hub.

## Why is a Hub and Spoke Distribution Model used?

The hub and spoke model is often used in supply chain management to streamline the distribution of goods and reduce costs. By centralizing the distribution process at a hub, companies can more efficiently consolidate and transport goods to multiple destinations, rather than shipping goods directly from a manufacturer to each individual location. This can help reduce transportation costs, as well as reduce the need for warehousing and storage space at each location.

This model is often used is because it allows for more efficient use of resources. For example, a central hub can be used to store and process large quantities of inventory, while the spoke locations can be used to distribute the inventory to customers in a more targeted and efficient manner. This can help reduce the overall cost of transportation and warehousing, as well as improve the speed and accuracy of delivery.

Companies in all markets are striving for same-day delivery as the market standard, and to achieve this, efficient and fast movement of goods is required.

## Advantages of a Hub and Spoke Distribution Model

There are several advantages to using a hub and spoke distribution model in a modern supply chain:

1. Cost savings: By consolidating shipments at a central hub, companies can reduce transportation costs and take advantage of economies of scale.

1. Efficiency: The hub and spoke model allows for efficient distribution of goods to multiple locations, as goods can be sorted and shipped to the appropriate spoke location from the central hub.

1. Inventory management: The centralization of the distribution process at a hub allows for better inventory management, as companies can more easily track and control the flow of goods.

1. Flexibility: The hub and spoke model allows for flexibility in the distribution process, as companies can easily add or remove spoke locations as needed.

1. Scalability: The hub and spoke model is scalable, as it can easily be expanded to accommodate growth or changes in the supply chain.

Overall, the hub and spoke distribution model is a useful tool for companies looking to streamline their supply chain and reduce costs. By centralizing the distribution process at a hub, companies can more efficiently distribute goods to multiple locations, while still maintaining control over inventory and the flow of goods.
