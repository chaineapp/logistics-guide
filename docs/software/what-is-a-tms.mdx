# What is a TMS?

## What is a transportation management system (TMS) in trucking and logistics?

A transportation management system (TMS) is a software application that is used to plan, optimize, and execute the movement of goods from one location to another. TMS systems are used in the trucking and logistics industry to help carriers, shippers, and other stakeholders coordinate and manage the transportation of goods.

A Transportation Management System (TMS) is what Brokers, Carriers, and Shippers use to manage all of their load, along with dealing with invoices, payments, and the overall management of the transportation division. A TMS (transportation management system) is used to plan freight movements, do freight rating and shopping across all modes, select the appropriate route and carrier, and manage freight bills and payments.

TMS systems typically include a range of features and functionality, including route planning and optimization, load planning, carrier selection, tracking and visibility, and freight billing and payment. They may also include tools for managing capacity, inventory, and demand, as well as for handling exceptions and issues that may arise during transportation.

TMS systems can be used to improve efficiency and reduce costs in the transportation process by automating and streamlining many of the tasks involved in coordinating and managing the movement of goods. They can also provide real-time visibility and tracking of shipments, helping stakeholders to better understand and manage the flow of goods.

Overall, TMS systems are an important tool in the trucking and logistics industry, helping to improve efficiency and coordination in the transportation of goods.
