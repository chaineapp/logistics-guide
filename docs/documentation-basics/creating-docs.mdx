# Creating Docs

Documentation files are located in the `docs` directory.

<br />

## Creating a section

Create a new directory in `docs/{section_name}` and add a `_category_.json` file. This file will contain the sidebar position of the section along with the title.

<br />

## Adding to an existing Section

1. Create a new `.mdx.` file in `docs//{section_name}` directory
2. Follow file naming convention: "{sectionName}-{pageTitle}.mdx"
3. Add the following at the top of the new .mdx file to modify the side bar positioning

```mdx
---
sidebar_position: 2
---
```

Make sure to Add the "title" you want displayed based on the file name.

<br />

## Commit your changes

Once you made edits and add a new file, you can live-test it by running the command

```
npx docusaurus start
```

Then open in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

## MDX

MDX supports Markdown out of the box. To learn more about markdown, see [markdown cheatsheet.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

These docs are written using .mdx files. Learn more about MDX in [their docs.](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started)

## How to customize the Theme

We use Smooth-Doc, which is a Gatsby theme to create this documentation. In simple terms, we are using a theme to get rid of all the complexity. As a result, if we want to make changes to the theme, we can use [smooth-docs documentation](https://smooth-doc.com/docs/getting-started/)
